# â˜• Neovim Dotfiles

## This project is built on top of [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) Architecture
#### There is no prerequisite to install my Dotfiles

- Clone this repo in your `nvim` folder.
- Launch nvim and a whole bunch of plugins will download and install.
- Re-launch nvim and press `m` on your keyboard to access Mason install whatever you need for Linters.
- You can tap spacebar to access the hotkeys, it's really easy to change in keymaps.lua
- You can add whatever plugins you'd like by creating a file in /lua/plugins Lazy will import it automagically.

I try and keep everything pretty simple, but please if you do have a question, even if you're working on your own project and you need some guidance - don't hesitate to reach out.

Enjoy,
